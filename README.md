Project: E-Commerce Product Listing App

In this assignment I focused on learning React and how to use {useState} and how to pass props from parent to child components. I put the components as their own files, and passed info from one to the next one using props and importing the parent file into the child. I learned how to set up what you are passing in App.jsx -> functio App() first using {useState}, then passing them to the next component when you set props in the "return <div>", then passing into the next component using another "return <div>" that maps the items and passes it to the next component, where the DOM structure is created.

I also added a drop down to filter items using a function with an event and using useState. I also added a button for add to cart the is not currently functional, but I could add functions to it later.

I also gave each .jsx file it's own corresponding .css file and linked them appropriately. I did not use any Bootstrap on this project, and used media queries and other CSS properties to make the website responsive. Again I designed a simple logo for the styling as well. I used images to make each product unique and put them in a "box" to keep them separated and easy to navigate.

Other elements I would add in the future would be other types of products/pages with filtering and combining filters, a nav bar, and a cart.
